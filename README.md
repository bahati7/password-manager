# Password Manager App
## Overview

This React application, built with Firebase, provides a secure and convenient way for users to manage their passwords. The app utilizes Google Authentication for login, generates strong passwords automatically, and allows users to store and manage their password credentials.

## Key Features:

Google Authentication: Users can log in to the app using their Google account, ensuring a secure and familiar authentication process.

Password Generation: The app generates strong, random passwords automatically, eliminating the need for users to create complex passwords manually.

Password Copy: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard with a simple click, making it convenient to use in other applications.

Password Storage: Users can store the generated password along with the corresponding app or site name in the application. This helps organize and manage passwords effectively.

Password Management: Users have the ability to view, edit, and delete stored passwords. This provides flexibility and control over their password data.
Technologies Used:

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Firebase: A backend-as-a-service platform that provides authentication, database, and hosting capabilities.
Google Authentication: A library for integrating Google sign-in into the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
